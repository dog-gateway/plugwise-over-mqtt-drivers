# Plugwise - MQTT driver #
This driver offers access to plugwise devices handled by  the [Plugwise-2.py](https://github.com/SevenW/Plugwise-2-py) python library and exposed through MQTT messages.

To properly work this bundle relies on the Dog [MQTT library](https://github.com/dog-gateway/mqtt), which shall be running prior to the bundle start-up (This will be fixed in the next releases).
